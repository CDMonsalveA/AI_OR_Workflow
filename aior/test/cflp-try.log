Cbc0038I No solution found this major pass
Cbc0038I Before mini branch and bound, 145 integers at bound fixed and 37417 continuous
Cbc0038I Full problem 40401 rows 40200 columns, reduced to 2837 rows 2638 columns
Cbc0038I Mini branch and bound did not improve solution (36.10 seconds)
Cbc0038I Full problem 40402 rows 40200 columns, reduced to 40402 rows 40200 columns - too large
