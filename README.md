Artificial Intelligence and Operations Research Workflow is a series of modules that allow the integration of Algorithms and Models from both fields to solve a real-world problem.

## Description

This project contains the basis used in the monograph to achieve the degree of industrial engineer entitled:
> [METHODOLOGICAL DESIGN FOR INTEGRATION OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: SUPPORT FOR LOCATION-ALLOCATION MODELING IN FOOD LOGISTICS](http://hdl.handle.net/11349/92955)

for the state of the repository at the time of the monograph, you can check tag [v1.0](github.com/CDMonsalveA/AI_OR_Workflow/releases/tag/v1.0)

created by:

[Cristian David Monsalve Alfonso](mailto:cdmonsalvea@udistrital.edu.co) (Code and innovation) and [Daniel Alejandro León Castañeda](mailto:danalleonc@udistrital.edu.co) (Theory)

## Objective

Create a conceptual base for the integration of Operations Research and Artificial Intelligence in order aid data-driven decision-making.
